Here are some of the sources that I used that I didn't think would be appropriate to cite inline:

CoreData:

iOS Icons:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28170520/ios-how-to-set-app-icon-and-launch-images/45122603#45122603

Everything else I tried to include at least once when I used outside code.
